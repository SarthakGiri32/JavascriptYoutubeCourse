/*
The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

A global variable, window, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with 
the concept of a user interface window. However, the Window interface is a suitable place to include these items that need to be globally available. 
Many of these are documented in the JavaScript Reference and the DOM Reference.

In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own Window object; the global window seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always 
represents the tab in which the code is running. That said, even in a tabbed browser, some properties and methods still apply to the overall window 
that contains the tab, such as resizeTo() and innerHeight. Generally, anything that can't reasonably pertain to a tab pertains to the window instead.
